# OPM Garage

Transform XML with the Open Processing Model, entirely in the browser. Runs the `opm` wheel under Pyodide (CPython in WebAssembly); there is no server-side code. Live at https://wolfgangmm.github.io/opm-garage/.

    uv build --wheel ../tei-publisher-py -o dist     # the opm wheel the page installs
    npm install
    npm run dev       # bundles src/ into dist/app.js on every change and serves http://localhost:8000
    npm run build     # minified bundle for deployment
    npm run check     # type check (TypeScript, no output)
    npm test          # unit tests, then every output mode headless under Pyodide in Node

The tests read ODDs and examples from the opm checkout at `../tei-publisher-py`; set `OPM_DIR` to use another path.

The page works on projects laid out like `opm init` creates them (`opm.toml`, `odd/`, `data/`, `templates/`). They live in the browser (IndexedDB), are saved as you type, and export as a `.zip` the `opm` CLI can run.

In Chrome, Edge and other Chromium browsers a project can also be kept in sync with a folder on disk: "Open folder…" on the start page turns a folder into a project, and "Sync with folder…" in the project menu links an open one. Changes flow both ways while the page is open; a file changed on both sides since the last sync is shown so you can pick a version. After a reload the browser may ask for access to the folder again. Firefox and Safari can't write to folders, so there the feature is hidden.

Every push to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`). The workflow builds the opm wheel from `eeditiones/open-processing-model` (`main` by default; run it by hand to pick another ref) and fails if the wheel's name differs from `WHEEL` in `src/config.ts`.

## Code layout

    src/main.ts           boot: wire the panes, load Python and opm, reopen the last project
    src/state.ts          the shared state and a small event bus
    src/actions.ts        changes to state that several panes care about (open a file, a project, …)
    src/config.ts         output modes, CDN URLs, the wheel name
    src/runtime/          Pyodide loading; glue.py and its typed wrappers in opm.ts
    src/project/          project files in Pyodide's file system, opm.toml, zip, IndexedDB, autosave, folder sync
    src/odd/              ODD parsing and in-place text edits behind the visual ODD editor (from ODDity)
    src/ui/               one module per pane or widget: editor, explorer, output, start, switcher, …
    src/ui/odd/           the visual ODD editor: Lit components ported from ODDity
    tests/unit/           node:test tests for the pure modules
    tests/node/           headless Pyodide runs of the wheel

The `chunk` output mode runs `opm chunk` and writes the pages to `/tmp/opm-chunks/` in Pyodide, outside the project. `src/ui/previews/site.ts` copies them into Cache Storage under `preview/<run>/`, and `sw.js` serves that path to the preview frame as a static server would.

The ODD editor's Document button runs `opm odd document` on the open ODD. Because a TEI customization takes close to a minute, it runs in a Web Worker with its own Pyodide (`src/runtime/docworker.ts`, bundled as `dist/docworker.js`), and the site is shown through the same `preview/` route. opm merges TEI customizations onto `p5all.xml.gz`, which it would download from a GitHub release. The browser cannot fetch that cross-origin, so the Pages build puts it in `dist/` beside the wheel. For local development, download it once:

    curl -sSfL -o dist/p5all.xml.gz https://github.com/eeditiones/open-processing-model/releases/download/tei-data/p5all.xml.gz

Panes never call each other. An action changes `state` and emits what changed (`project`, `files`, `config`, `edit`, `file`, `source`, `sync`, `docs`); each pane subscribes to the events that affect it in its `init…()` function.
